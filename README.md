# SPI Slave with Single Port RAM using Verilog
This project involves the design and implementation of an SPI Slave with Single Port RAM using Verilog. The project is divided into three main modules: the SPI Slave, Single Port RAM, and a Wrapper. The SPI Slave is implemented using a Finite State Machine (FSM).
